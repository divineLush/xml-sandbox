XML Schema (XSD)


The new standard for describing XML documents.
Use the same syntax as XML.
Provide us with specific data types that we can use to define our XML data.
Describes the type and values that can be placed into each element or attribute.
XML data constraints are called facets.
The purpose is the same as DTD.
