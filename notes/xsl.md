XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language)


Is used to create a style sheet that describes how data formatted with XML should be presented to the user.
Provides tools to describe exactly which data fields in an XML file to display and exactly where and how to display that data.
Can be used to define how an XML file should be displayed by transforming the XML file into a format that is recognizable to a browser.
Each XML element is transformed into HTML element.

XSL consists of three parts necessary for displaying XML data:
- XSLT  a language for transforming XML documents
- XPath  a language for navigating in XML documents
- XSL-FO  a language for formatting XML documents
